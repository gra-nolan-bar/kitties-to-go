          <h3>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h3>
          <p>
            Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees
            and purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws
            clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the
            warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap
            attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and
            bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now
            i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the
            dog likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs
            at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum
            cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are
            asleep stretch.
